          <h3>Ian Lusule</h3>
          
          <p>Hello, my name is Ian Lusule, and I am currently a second-year student at DKUT University. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. One of the many modules in my course involves programming, which I find both fascinating and challenging. Through this module, I have gained experience in various programming languages, including C, Java, and Prolog.</p>

      <div class="width-50">
        <img src="images/about-us1.jpg" class="about-img">
      </div>
          <p>My journey into the world of programming started with learning C language. Understanding the fundamentals of programming through C helped me grasp the core principles and techniques required to build software applications. Currently, I am honing my skills in Java, which is widely known for its versatility and robustness in the industry. Additionally, I am also delving into Prolog, a logic programming language that enables intelligent problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Programming has allowed me to develop a logical mindset and enhance my problem-solving abilities. The ability to write efficient and structured code has become a crucial skill that I aim to continuously improve upon. I find joy in the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and creating elegant solutions for them through programming.</p>

          <p>Throughout my studies, I have actively engaged in hands-on projects and assignments that have further deepened my understanding of programming concepts. I have had the opportunity to work on real-world applications, collaborate with fellow programmers, and gain practical experience in software development.</p>

          <p>With each passing day, I am becoming more passionate about programming and its potential to transform the technological landscape. My goal is to constantly expand my knowledge and skills in different programming languages and frameworks to become a proficient software engineer who can contribute to the development of innovative solutions. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead on my journey as a computer science student.</p>
